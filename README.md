# STAT8056 tutorial session


The complementary notebook (using Google Colab) can be accessed from [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1N2F-X4Q9-9Dr-zuUNMPUZQb8of3HMHc5?usp=sharing).

Tutorial session (on PyTorch basics) for [STAT8056](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~xshen/stat8056.htm), UMN Statistics. The following topics will be covered:
* Set up the working/coding environment for Python (either locally or on a remote host)
* PyTorch basics (tensors, computation graph, gradient tracing, GPU computation)
* Use PyTorch to build general ML/DL pipelines for your research, with some examples including:
  * Use SGD to do linear regression, the naive way, and the PyTorch way
  * Fit a ReLU neural network to learn the sine function, w./w.o. regularization
  * Design and train a CNN to perform classification on the MNIST dataset
* Some resources and tools to help you understand DL and PyTorch better.
